Run `npm install`.
Run `index.js` to start the server on `127.0.0.1:3030`

GET/PUT/POST/DELETE available on `/lineups`

`create.js` is a WIP, I'm refactoring the lineup generation from my old AngularJs project, available here: https://lineupgenerator.neocities.org/...

If you run `create.js` today it will generate some arrays and post them to `/lineups`, where you can view them on `http://localhost:3030/lineups`
